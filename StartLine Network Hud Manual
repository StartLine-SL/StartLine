StartLine Network Hud Manual

The network Hud has to be used to connect two StartLine lines in a network. Its use is simple, but you have to know what you want to do.

The Hud consists of 5 buttons that I will describe below:

Start button.
* It acts by proximity to a line that is less than 100 meters away.
* Pressing the button puts the line in "Waiting Start" mode.
* Pressing again puts the line in "Race" mode
* For the line to be put on "Waiting Start" the line has to be idle and does not have to be blocked by another Avatar.

Finish button.
* It acts by proximity to a line that is less than 100 meters away.
* Pressing the button puts the line in "Waiting Finish" mode.
* Pressing again puts the line in "Race" mode
* For the line to be put on "Waiting Finish" the line has to be idle and does not have to be blocked by another Avatar.

Lock button
* Activate / Deactivate the line lock.
* It is not necessary to be near a line.
* If this button is active when the lines will be connected they will be locked by the owner of the hud.
* If the owner of the hud is an Admin the line will be locked as "Hard Lock" otherwise it will be locked as "Soft Lock".
* The lock time can be set through the menu.

Connect button
* Establishes the connection between two lines.
* It is not necessary to be near any line.
* The "Start" and "Finish" buttons must be lit and the lines must be in "Waiting" mode.
* When connecting, the lines are put in "Start" mode and in "Finish" mode.
* Pressing when the lines are connected puts them in "Waiting" mode.
* If when pressing the button, the "Lock" button is lit, it will lock the lines.

Menu button
* Allows you to set the lock time.
* Allows Resetting the Hud
* Allows you to clean the "Start", "Finish" and "Connect buttons. (It does NOT reset the lines, it only clears the Hud).


How to use
* Stand near one of the two lines to be connected.
* Verify that it is not blocked by someone else and that it is idle.
* Press the "Start" or "Finish" button as appropriate.
* Repeat the previous three steps for the other line.
* Set the lock time with the "Menu" button.
* Press the "Lock" button to lock the lines.
* Press the "Connect" button to connect the two lines.
* The message "Connection Established" will appear in your chat.


Observations
* If the connection cannot be established, the Connect button will turn red and a message will appear in the chat.
* To invert the direction of the race, press the "Net Invert" option in the line menu.
* To end the race and restore the lines, change one of the lines to "Race" mode. DO NOT press the "Connect" button that would put the lines in "Waiting" mode and they would no longer be connected.
