ABOUT StartLine
This is an update to the start line that Kanker Greenacre created and Cynthia Centaur updated with Open Source code.  A best effort has been made to duplicate the functionality of Hay An's  raceline vs 2.30.2. Match, Trial and Networked Lines have been deferred to the next release.

The idea of making a start line that belongs to the community has come from the sailing community itself. I think the best way to build something for everyone is by sharing and collaborating with each other. This has been the main motivation that has led me to update this old code.

To make it as transparent as possible I have chosen the GPL copyleft license, which gives users freedom. Therefore, whether it is complicated or simple depends only on ourselves and the will to do it well.

Lalia

Here is what Hay An had to say in his "raceline" help file.

"This raceline is made because i wanted to give some pleasure back to the sailing community...
It's specificly designed for the sailing community and offers all features nessecary for racing.
Everyone should be able to enjoy sailing everywhere and with everyone....
....this line is an extension to that thought.
   Hay An"

It is delivered with all the permits, under the GPL license. see license for more details.

REZZING StartLine

- Rezzing - After rezzing the line it will reset automaticly and it will be ready for use immediatly. Repositioning and rotating the line is very easy, because it's just 1 object you need to edit (it's all linked). Once it is in place you will have to place the buoys at ether end of the line. The separate timer can be placed anywhere in the same region. 

- Resizing - The line length can be set up from 8 to 118 meters long in 0.5 meter increments.  It can be fine tuned via dialog using the Adjustment option.  

USING StartLine:

Using this line is done by dialog menu's.  Just click anywhere on the start line to get an options-menu.

Announcements can be heard within 100 meters of the start line.

Note A - Locking the Line

Hardlock - Set in the owners menu and can only be locked/unlocked by someone with owner privileges. The lock is set for the time set in Lock Time in Dialog 2.

Automatic Lock - Set when the race starts unless turned off in settings (autolock=0). Gets length in minutes from settings (autolocktime). 

Manual Lock - Length in minutes and locking are in dialog 2.   As stated in Note B anyone can unlock this lock.  A more accurate title might be "let me know if you are want to or have already taken the the lock ".

Note B - Unlocking the Line

Hardlocks can be unlocked by anyone who has owner authority .
  
Automatic locks default to only the locker or someone with owner authority can unlock (autolocktype=1) . If autolocktype=0 it works the same way that manual locks do.

Manual locks can be unlocked by anyone.  Click the line and you get a dialog box. Clicking the line when it is manually locked  gives a dialog containing IM to holder and a button to unlock the line.  While not required by the dialog it does make it easy to IM the lock holder.

Note  C - Boat Detection

The boat is added to a race as it crosses the start line if it has an "ID".  The ID for the boat is the string of characters following the "#" in the boats name.  Here are some examples.
            Flying Tako 3.3 #70HA                                         --> ID = 70HA
            WildWind ACJ90-AR_WP ver3.0(Hay Ah) #010        --> ID = 010
            Trudeau Leetle Cat #086GFD Yes                         --> ID = 086GFD
            Flying Fizz 3.0 6 #564                                         --> ID = 564
            
The line tracks boats by owner and ID.  While it is possible to have duplicates, it is not likely and can be avoided by alert RDs.

Note D - settings File

Located in the Start Line's inventory and can be changed by anyone with Owner authority.  The function of the keys are described in either the settings file or Design Kit readme.
