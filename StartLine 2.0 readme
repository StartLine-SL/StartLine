ABOUT StartLine
This is an update to the start line that Kanker Greenacre created and Cynthia Centaur updated with Open Source code.  A best effort has been made to duplicate the functionality of Hay An's  raceline vs 2.30.2. StartLine is compatible with Hay An's raceline with some additional functions.

The idea of making a start line that belongs to the community has come from the sailing community itself. I think the best way to build something for everyone is by sharing and collaborating with each other. This has been the main motivation that has led me to update this old code.

To make it as transparent as possible I have chosen the GPL copyleft license, which gives users freedom. Therefore, whether it is complicated or simple depends only on ourselves and the will to do it well.

Lalia

Here is what Hay An had to say in his "raceline" help file.

"This raceline is made because i wanted to give some pleasure back to the sailing community...
It's specificly designed for the sailing community and offers all features nessecary for racing.
Everyone should be able to enjoy sailing everywhere and with everyone....
....this line is an extension to that thought.
   Hay An"

It is delivered with all the permits, under the GPL license. see license for more details.

REZZING StartLine

- Rezzing - After rezzing the line it will reset automaticly and it will be ready for use immediatly. Repositioning and rotating the line is very easy, because it's just 1 object you need to edit (it's all linked). Once it is in place you will have to place the buoys at ether end of the line. The separate timer can be placed anywhere in the same region. 

- Resizing - The line length can be set up from 8 to 107 meters long in 0.5 meter increments.  It can be fine tuned via dialog using the Adjustment option.  

USING StartLine:

Using this line is done by dialog menu's.  Just click anywhere on the start line to get an options-menu.

Announcements can be heard within 100 meters of the start line.

 1) Close Menu - Closes the dialog window. 
 
 2) Start - Starts the pre-race clocks and resets racers information.   
 
 3) Finish/Restart 
    - This option stops the timer and resets the count down time.  Results (#4)  are available until another race is started.

     - Pre-race maneuvering time. Integer range of 1 to 5 minutes. Race starts when timer reaches zero..
    
 8) Load Default - Restores settings to the default (see Administrator's Dialog for saving defaults). Note race mode is not one of the items restored.
    
 9) Mode - Brings up another Menu which gives you a choice of the StartLine's Modes. Any one of 8 modes which are organized into 3 categories:  Count Down, Count down and up and Training.
    
      􀀁
     
      ) Up                a)  Trial                     b) Trial Series
    c) Race             d)  Multi Start            e) Network
    f) Match Race    g)  Start Training       h) Race Training
      
    A)  CLOCK ONLY COUNTS DOWN.  Once started racer's may start at anytime before the clock goes to zero.  Note G
        a - Trial - In Trial Race Mode, the line is open for one to 30 hours (Set by selecting Race Time in Dialog 1)  and racers can start their single timed run at any time during that period.  
        b - Trial Series - the difference between Trial Series and Trials is in Trial Series the racer may run the race up to 9 times with only their best time counting.

    B)  CLOCK COUNTS DOWN AND THEN UP:
        c -  Race - Count Down followed by a count up, a single race that starts and ends at the same line. 
        d -  Multi Start  - Count Down followed by a count up, with 2 - 4 races using the line concurrently, each race that starts and ends at the same line. 
        e - Network - Count Down followed by a count up, a single race that starts and ends at different StartLine. Considerations and detailed instructions are in Note F.
        f -  Match - Two boats with a multi stage Count Down and the race starts and ends at the same Line.
        
    C) Finally there are 2 training modes, Start and Race.   
        g -  Start Training  -  If you have been getting killed at the start line, this mode is made for you.  Turn it on, select the Countdown Time and practice your start timing to your heart's content.  Once a your boat crosses the line the pre race timer is reset to the Countdown Time.
        h -  Race Training - Race and Start Train Modes are similar in that they set up StarLine to allow you to do something repetitively.  For Race Training mode it is probably a course you wish to practice multiple times.
     
   
      
    12) Lock -  Manually soft locks (anyone can unlock it)  the line for the number defined in Lock Time option. See Notes A and B for more information.

     - Range of 0 - 210 seconds.  As an example if 30 seconds is chosen a racer cannot recross the finish line until at least 30 seconds into the race. This option is important when a runner stays on the line can mark several wrong line crossings.

    15) Invisible - Toggles line between visible and invisible.
    
    16) <<<<  -  Returns to Dialog 1
    
    17) Help - Gives the person making the request a copy of this document.

    21) Reset - Reset scripts and loads the default options saved with "Save Opt".    
       
    22) Unlock - Brings up a dialog that allows person to unlock either a Manual or Automatic lock. See notes A and B for more information.   
       
    23) Hardlock - Locks line from use by anyone except Admins for the number of minutes in Locktime. See notes A and B for more information.   
       
    24) Line length - Change the length of the race line.  Line can be set from 8 meters to 107 meters in half meter increments. 
       
Note A - Locking the Line

Hardlock - Set in the owners menu and can only be locked/unlocked by someone with Admin privileges. The lock is set for the time set in Lock Time in Dialog 2.

Automatic Lock - Set when the race starts unless turned off in settings (autolock=0). Gets length in minutes from settings (autolocktime). 

Manual Lock - Length in minutes and locking are in dialog 2.   As stated in Note B anyone can unlock this lock.  A more accurate title might be "let me know if you are want to or have already taken the the lock ".

Note B - Unlocking the Line

Hardlocks can be unlocked by anyone who has Admin authority .
  
Automatic locks default to only the locker or someone with Admin authority can unlock (autolocktype=1) . If autolocktype=0 it works the same way that manual locks do.

Manual locks can be unlocked by anyone.  Click the line and you get a dialog box. Clicking the line when it is manually locked  gives a dialog containing IM to holder and a button to unlock the line.  While not required by the dialog it does make it easy to IM the lock holder.

Note  C - Boat Detection

The boat is added to a race as it crosses the start line if it has an "ID".  The ID for the boat is the string of characters following the "#" in the boats name.  The ID of the boat is limited to 6 characters. Longer ID will be truncated.  

Here are some examples.

            Flying Tako 3.3 #70HA                                         --> ID = 70HA
            WildWind ACJ90-AR_WP ver3.0(Hay Ah) #010        --> ID = 010
            Trudeau Leetle Cat #086GFD Yes                         --> ID = 086GFD
            Flying Fizz 3.0 6 #564                                         --> ID = 564
            
The line tracks boats by owner and ID.  While it is possible to have duplicates, it is not likely and can be avoided by alert RDs.

Note D - settings File

Located in the Start Line's inventory and can be changed by anyone with Owner authority.  The function of the keys are described in either the settings file or Design Kit readme.

Note E - Network Mode Timing

* The data from the start to the finish line are sent 4 minutes after starting the race, in groups of 10 racers every minute. Once all the groups have been sent, the subsequent runners that cross the line are sent individually.
* This means that for a 10 runner race the time between the starting line and the finish line has to be a minimum of 4 minutes. If it is 20 runners, the time will be 5 minutes.
*  For security it is recommended that the time to travel the distance between the two lines is a minimum of 10 minutes.

Note F -  - Networked races, which start at one StartLine and end at another, are easy to run, once they are setup correctly.  Due to communications issues results may become unreliable if the Finish line is less than 10 racing minutes from the Start Line.  

To see how Network mode works, see the Network Hud manual included in the package
                    
Note G - Trial or Trial Series Mode
This is done using a countdown timer and racers may start the race as long as the timer is greater than 0.  In Trial Series Mode the racer may run the race up to 9 times with the best time counting for their result.

Trial races may run for up to 24 hours and the line can be locked for 30 hours.  Trial Series are limited to 2 hour length and 3 hours locktime due to data storage issues.

To support long running races the line can be locked for up to 30 hours and races may be open for up to 24 hours. Having the line locked for the entire period a long Trial will run is critcal.  Imagine someone coming along at the 20 hour mark of a 24 hour Trial and unwittingly resetting the line.

To do so from Dialog 2 select Lock Time, then Others and enter the number of minutes the line is to locked  (15 - 1800).  The time the Trial or Trial Series race is to be open is set in Dialog 1 by Selecting Race Time.
